# <React.StrictMode> => It calls the component twice... jsut to make sure its calling properly... Only happens in Dev


# Debouncing
    - Typing slow - 200ms
    - Typing Fast - 30ms


#Performance 
    - iPhone Pro Max = 14 * 1000 = 14000
    - with Debouncing= 3 API * 1000 = 3000

    Debouncing with 200ms 
        => if diff b/w 2 keyStrokes is less than 200ms -> Not call API /decline API call
        => if diff b/w 2 keyStrokes is more than 200ms -> make API call
